Adaptive density estimation by Bayesian averaging
=====
The original article describing the ADEBA method will be submitted to a scientific journal in the near future.
At that time, ready-to-use implementations for MATLAB and R will be posted in this repository,
together with the code required to perform and plot the simulations of the paper.
