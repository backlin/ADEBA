Adaptive density estimation by Bayesian averaging
=====
This repo contains an R implementation of the ADEBA density estimation method
and a benchmark study comparing it to a number of other methods.

More details on ADEBA and a reference to the original article will be posted here
once it has been accepted by a scientific journal (at the moment it is in submission).

Installation
------------
On Linux/Unix/Mac, run `R/install.sh` to automatically build the package locally and
install it.

The package will be available on CRAN soon, currently under review.
